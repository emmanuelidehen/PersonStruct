/*
 * Write a program that creates an array of a Person of size 5. Populate the array of object with information given
 * by the user input according to the following specifications:
 * Populate only 3 positions of the array of person object, populate only 2 positions of the family members names array
 * for each object, and ouput only the contents of the person object that contains user inputted information
 *
 * Create a structure person that has this members: full name, age, family member full names represented by an array
 * of size (10)
 */

/*
 Psuedo code:
 structure person : (full_name, age, family_full_name[size(10)])
 make size equal const int (5)
 first create an array of person putting size into it
 Ask the user for some input and store the input into the array!
 fill only three positions of five positions of the array using a loop(size-2)
 fill only two position of the family member array.(arraysize - 8)
 output only the content of the person oblect that contains user inputted information.
